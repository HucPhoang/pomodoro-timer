## 📚 Project

I enjoy using productivity apps, especially the Pomodoro timer. Unfortunately, my iPhone doesn't have enough storage to download them. As a result, I created this webpage where I can practice my skills and knowledge while building it.

It's not the best project ever, but I did my best.
